# Making the repository

* Create GitHub account and repository
* Create ssh key if haven't already, add public one to GitHub account
* Clone repository
* ` ssh -T git@github.com`
* Set as 'origin' on workstation
* Commit and push

**Have not** add most of the commands as they are relatively arbitrary to look up and reasonably self-explanatory (especially if copying directly from the repository and not initialises it within the terminal)
