# Critical Thinking

## What is critical thinking?

* Helps create strong arguments by justifying claims with evidence
* Can contribute to any role as it requires the ability to gather information, analyse it and evaluate it
* TRY GET THE 'TRUTH'

## Critical Thinking Skills
* Actively seeking out all sides of the arguments
* Checking the facts
* Responding objectively

## Levels of Intellectual Skills
* Thinking triangle, Benjamin Blooms
	* Six levels of thinking skills

## Critical thinking Process
3 steps:
* **Identify:**
	* Main points of argument
	* The claims being made
	* The evidence that is being used
	* The conclusions reached
* **Analyse** (by asking the following):
	* Does information make sense in relation to other research?
	* How old is the research?
	* Is the material clear, or is more needed to aid understanding?
	* Does the argument present a balanced view or are some topics diregarded?
* **To apply and compare** (looking out for):
	* The implications of the other information
	* Weaknesses when applied to a real-life situation
	* A lack of coverage

## 3 Modes of Thinking
//TODO look over these more
* **Divergent:**
	* Question → Idea
* **Convergent:**
	* Facts → Answer
* **Lateral:**
	* Uses both of the previous ones

## Six Thinking Hats
Developed as a parallel thinking process, see _Communication.md_ for more details about the hats. When to apply each of the hats is purely situational.

## Incorrect Attitudes
* **Ignorant Certainty:**
	* The belief that there are definite answers to all questions
* **Naive Relativism:**
	* The belief that there is no trurth and all arguments are equal

## Enquiry-Based Learning
A way of learning that is based upon asking questions.

### The Enquiry Cycle
![](The-Enquiry-Cycle.png "The Enquiry Cycle")

**What kinds of questions might we ask when thinking critically?:**
* What is the source of the evidence?
* What kinds of claims are being made?
* Where is the evidence for these claims?
* What are the strenghts and weaknesses?
* How clear are the points?
* Is it a balanced argument?
* Are there any underlying themes?
* Do we understand the background?
* Are the examples good?
* etc.

## What is an argument?

### Basic Argument Structure
* **Claim:**
	* Present your argument within a clear statement
* **Evidence:**
	* Present evidence to support your claim
* **Impact:**
	* Explain the significance of the evidence .i.e. how does it support your claim?

### Evaluate an argument
Consider the following:
* Do the claims make logical sense?
* Are the claims based on opinion or supported with evidence?
* Are any assumptions made?
* Have all alternatives been considered?
* Does the evidence support all the claims made?
* Is the evidence appropriate for the topic?
* etc.

### Challenging an argument?
Debating etiquette:
* Acknowledge the other person's view before challenging it
* Be constructive rather than simple dismissing the other person's point of view
* Reflect on the strengths of the other person's argument
* Respectful, language used etc

#### Objective Phrasing
Try using objective phrasing like "It could be argued that..." rather than "I think".

#### Logical Fallacies
Look out for logical fallacies such as false dichotomy, false equivalence, assertion, no true Scotsman, appeal to authority etc.

## The Art Of Persuasion
